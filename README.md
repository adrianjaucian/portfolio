# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Repository! 👋

Hello there! I'm Adrian Jaucian, a passionate data enthusiast and aspiring data scientist with a knack for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. This space is dedicated to showcasing my journey through the world of data science, machine learning, and data engineering, with a touch of creativity and innovation.

🚀 Projects at a Glance:
Explore a variety of personal projects that reflect my diverse interests and skills. From predictive modeling to data visualization, each project is a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data. I have a particular interest in the every growing research into sport analytics. While more and more data is being collected in this industry, I am passionate about how innovative we can be in the deployment of this new information!

📚 Educational Background:
I hold a solid foundation in data science, now in the last semester of my bachelors degree in Data Analytics at The University of South Australia, with a specialization in machine learning and data engineering. I also spent a semester studying at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, South Korea, specialising in more software engineering areas. My academic journey equipped me with a strong command of Python, the language that serves as my primary tool in crafting data-driven solutions.

💻 Tech Stack:

Programming Languages: Python (proficient), SQL (limited experience), R (limited experience), Java (basic understanding)
Tools & Frameworks: R Studio, HTML, Tableau

🌐 Project Highlights:

Embiid23: An in-depth visual analysis of Joel Embiid's 2022/23 MVP Season.\
WAR_Alternative: A predictive model built to use as an alternative metric to WAR in baseball.\
Textbased_Dice_Game: 3 simple text-based dice games using python.
